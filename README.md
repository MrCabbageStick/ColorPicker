# Basic HTML, CSS & JS HSL Color Picker

A simple to use and easy to implement color picker.\
Created with JavaScript.

Made mostly for use in my future projects.


### Usage

Download a file: ```colorWheel.js```.\
To use it in HTML add a script tag: ```<script src="path/to/colorWheel.js">```.\
Then create an object based on a ```colorPicker``` class (constructor parameters are described with JsDoc).
